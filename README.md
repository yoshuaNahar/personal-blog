# How to run
- `sdk install jbake`
- `jbake -b -s` (version was 2.6.4)

# How to deploy
- `jbake -b`
- push to git

# Todo
- Add scss support
- Check if there is a better way to go from words to content (now I need to add the p and h5 tags manually. Retry markdown, last time it had a weird line separation on /n)
- Add tags page and aside section on index.html
- Add archive page and aside section on index.html (years)
- Add a intro on index.html, not the entire post
- Add a next page button
- Make tags clickable
- Make year clickable

If i hadn't used [JBake](https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake),
I would probably use
[Orchid](https://github.com/JavaEden/Orchid) (Java),
[Hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) (Node.js),
[Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/) (Node.js) or
[Spike](https://github.com/static-dev/spike) (Node.js, based on Webpack).
This photographer SSG [Expose](https://github.com/Jack000/Expose) also looked interesting.
